char c[] = {a,s,s,m,a}
String s = new String(c);
assma --

format for String ffunction
public final class String extends object charsequence, searializable ,comparable (){}

	
SCP(String constant pool is made to store values) will store the value, the variable is stored in heap memory

String s1 = new String("ameya")
String s1 = new String("ameya")

immutability concept is used for string object that means string objects are immutable
It's value cant be changed .ie., it cant be reassigned

how to change value of String is shown below

package blabal;

public class ameya {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		String s="Ameya";
		s=s.concat("assaas");
		System.out.println(s);
	}
}


Difference in SCP and HEap

scp uses 1 object example: s1="ameya" s2 ='ameya', scp will refer to one object
however in heap there will be 2 "Ameya" objects

COnstructor

char []c = {'a','b','c'}
String s7 = new String(c);
System.out.println(s7);
//why is char array is reffered over string  for storying password?
String objects are immmutable in java therefore if a password is stored as plain text , it willl be available in memory, until garbage collector clears it, but string objects
 are stored in string constant pool for reusability and garbage collections is not applicable in scp which is security threat
